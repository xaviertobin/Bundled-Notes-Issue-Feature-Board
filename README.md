# Bundled Notes Issue Board

This is the official source for keeping track of progress, reporting bugs and requesting features for Bundled Notes - the Android and Web app. Please visit the 'Issues' tab, and read the following instructions before posting:

# Instructions:

- Include context for reported issues, especially if the functionality normally works. This includes what lead to the issue, and devices/OS version you have. Where possible, include screenshots and videos - these can save hours in solving the issue and potentially lead to fast-tracked fixes. Issues that are far too vague will be closed simply on the basis that there's nothing to go off for finding a solution/the problem is unclear.

- One issue/feature request per post. For example, don't say "Formatting bar doesn't have checklist options + checklists should continue when you go to the next line.". These are two seperate concerns and may be addressed in different updates. These posts will be closed.

- If an issue is critical, please label it as such. Do not mislabel issues to give them more attention - this will typically lead to an issue being closed for mislabelling and slow down a solution.

- Duplicate issues will be deleted straight away. If an issue you've found is effecting you and someone else, give that issue a thumbs up.

- Please be polite. I have spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours working on both apps - if there's something you want in the app, no matter how important or critical it might be, please file the request factually, without frustration, without ranting. The vast majority of the time, the only reason a feature you're requesting isn't available yet is because I'm a solo developer and time is finite.

- Discussion about the app in general should be for the bundled subreddit.

- Be nice!
